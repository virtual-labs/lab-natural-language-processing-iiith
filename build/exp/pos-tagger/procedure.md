This interactive simulation allows you to explore Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging by configuring different parameters and observing their impact on tagging accuracy. Follow these Steps to conduct your experiments.

### **Step 1: Access the Simulation**

- Open the simulation interface
- Read the instructions panel to understand the overall workflow
- Click on the instructions header to expand/collapse detailed guidance

### **Step 2: Language Selection**

- Click on the language dropdown menu
- **Choose from available options**:
  - **English**: Standard Latin script with rich morphology
  - **Hindi**: Devanagari script with complex morphological features
- **Note**: Different languages present unique tagging challenges due to:
  - Script differences (Latin vs. Devanagari)
  - Morphological complexity
  - Word order variations

### **Step 3: Configure Training Corpus Size**

- Select the size of the training corpus from the dropdown:
  - **Small (1K sentences)**: Fast training, limited accuracy
  - **Medium (10K sentences)**: Balanced performance
  - **Large (50K sentences)**: Best accuracy, slower training
  - **Extra Large (100K sentences)**: Maximum accuracy potential

**Impact**: Larger corpora provide:

- More diverse word-tag combinations
- Better statistical estimates
- Improved handling of rare constructions
- Higher computational requirements

### **Step 4: Algorithm Selection**

- Choose the machine learning algorithm:
  - **HMM (Hidden Markov Model)**:
    - Probabilistic approach
    - Uses transition and emission probabilities
    - Efficient with moderate accuracy
  - **CRF (Conditional Random Field)**:
    - Discriminative model
    - Handles rich feature sets
    - Higher accuracy, more computational cost

### **Step 5: Feature Configuration**

- Select the context features for training:
  - **Unigram**: Uses only current word
    - Fastest processing
    - Limited context information
  - **Bigram**: Considers current and previous word/tag
    - Better disambiguation
    - Moderate computational cost
  - **Trigram**: Uses current and two previous words/tags
    - Rich contextual information
    - Higher accuracy for complex constructions
    - Increased computational requirements

### **Step 6: Train and Test the Model**

- Click the **"Train & Test"** button
- **Wait for processing**: The system will:
  - Simulate training with your selected parameters
  - Calculate accuracy metrics
  - Prepare demo examples

### **Step 7: Analyze Results**

The results panel will display:

#### **Accuracy Metrics**

- **Overall Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly tagged words
- **Performance Summary**: Brief analysis of results
- **Configuration Details**: Reminder of selected parameters

#### **Interactive Demo**

- **Example Dropdown**: Select from pre-processed sentences
- **POS Tag Visualization**: See tagged output with:
  - Original sentence
  - Word-by-word POS tags
  - Color-coded visualization (if available)

### **Step 8: Experiment with Different Configurations**

- Click **"Try Another Configuration"** to reset the simulation
- **Systematic Experimentation**:
  1. Keep some parameters constant while varying others
  2. Compare results across different configurations
  3. Note patterns and performance trends
