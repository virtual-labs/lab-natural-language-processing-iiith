This experiment demonstrates Hidden Markov Models for POS tagging through an interactive simulation. Follow these steps to understand and practice HMM-based POS tagging:

### Step 1: Understanding the Interface

The simulation interface consists of several key components:

- **Corpus Display Area**: Shows the training corpus with word/tag pairs
- **Transition Matrix**: Displays probabilities of moving from one POS tag to another
- **Emission Matrix**: Shows probabilities of observing words given POS tags
- **Input Section**: Where you can enter sentences for POS tagging
- **Results Display**: Shows the step-by-step Viterbi algorithm execution

### Step 2: Examine the Training Corpus

1. Review the provided training corpus displayed in the interface
2. Observe how words are paired with their corresponding POS tags
3. Notice the format: `word/tag` for each token
4. Pay attention to special markers like `EOS/eos` (End of Sentence)

### Step 3: Analyze the Probability Matrices

**Transition Matrix:**

1. Examine the transition probabilities between POS tags
2. Each cell shows P(tag_j | tag_i) - probability of tag_j following tag_i
3. Notice how certain tag sequences are more likely than others
4. Observe the probabilities for sentence-initial tags from EOS

**Emission Matrix:**

1. Study the emission probabilities for words given POS tags
2. Each cell shows P(word | tag) - probability of observing a word given a tag
3. Notice how some words can have multiple possible tags with different probabilities
4. Observe cases of ambiguous words (like "cut" which can be noun or verb)

### Step 4: Interactive POS Tagging

1. **Enter a Test Sentence**: Input a sentence in the provided text field
2. **Initiate Tagging**: Click the "Tag Sentence" or similar button to start the process
3. **Observe the Viterbi Algorithm**: Watch the step-by-step execution:
   - **Initialization**: See how initial probabilities are calculated for the first word
   - **Forward Pass**: Observe how probabilities are computed for each subsequent word
   - **Path Tracking**: Notice how the algorithm keeps track of the most likely paths
   - **Backtracking**: See how the final tag sequence is determined

### Step 5: Analyze Results

1. **Review the Final Tag Sequence**: Examine the most likely POS tags assigned to each word
2. **Study the Probability Scores**: Understand the confidence scores for each tagging decision
3. **Compare Different Paths**: If available, compare alternative tag sequences and their probabilities
4. **Understand Context Effects**: Notice how context influences tag assignment for ambiguous words

### Step 6: Experiment with Different Inputs

1. **Try Various Sentence Types**:

   - Simple sentences with common words
   - Sentences with ambiguous words
   - Complex sentences with multiple clauses
   - Sentences with less common words

2. **Observe Different Behaviors**:
   - How does sentence length affect processing?
   - What happens with unknown or rare words?
   - How do different word orders impact tagging?

### Step 7: Matrix Calculation Practice (if available)

If the simulation includes interactive matrix calculation:

1. **Fill Emission Probabilities**:

   - Count word-tag co-occurrences in the corpus
   - Calculate P(word|tag) = count(word,tag) / count(tag)
   - Enter calculated values in the matrix cells

2. **Fill Transition Probabilities**:

   - Count tag-tag transitions in the corpus
   - Calculate P(tag_j|tag_i) = count(tag_i,tag_j) / count(tag_i)
   - Enter calculated values in the matrix cells

3. **Verify Your Calculations**: Use the "Check" button to validate your answers
   - Correct answers will be highlighted in green
   - Incorrect answers will be highlighted in red
   - Review and correct any mistakes

### Step 8: Advanced Exploration

1. **Modify Parameters** (if available): Experiment with different probability values to see their effects
2. **Compare Algorithms**: If multiple algorithms are available, compare their performance
3. **Error Analysis**: Identify common tagging errors and understand their causes
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Analyze accuracy and efficiency metrics

### Learning Outcomes

By completing this procedure, you will:

- Understand how HMMs work for POS tagging
- Learn to calculate transition and emission probabilities
- Experience the Viterbi algorithm in action
- Recognize the importance of context in disambiguation
- Appreciate the challenges and limitations of statistical NLP approaches

### Tips for Success

- **Take Time to Understand**: Don't rush through the matrices; understanding the probabilities is crucial
- **Experiment Actively**: Try different sentences to see how the algorithm responds
- **Pay Attention to Ambiguity**: Focus on how ambiguous words are resolved
- **Connect Theory to Practice**: Relate what you see in the simulation to the theoretical concepts
- **Ask Questions**: Consider why certain tagging decisions are made and explore edge cases
