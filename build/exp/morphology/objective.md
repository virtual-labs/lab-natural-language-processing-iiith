After completing this experiment, students will be able to:

1. **Analyze Hindi Word Structure**: Identify and decompose Hindi words into their morphological components (root + affixes) with 85% accuracy across different word categories, demonstrating understanding of Hindi morphological patterns.

2. **Apply Add-Delete Methodology**: Correctly identify what needs to be deleted from and added to root words to create different grammatical forms, achieving 80% accuracy in morphological transformation tasks.

3. **Understand Hindi Paradigms**: Analyze and classify Hindi words according to their paradigm classes, recognizing how words with similar morphological patterns behave consistently across different grammatical categories.

4. **Master Grammatical Features**: Correctly identify and apply Hindi grammatical features including gender (लिंग), number (वचन), and case (कारक), demonstrating understanding of how these features modify word forms.

5. **Practice Systematic Analysis**: Develop hands-on skills in performing systematic morphological analysis using the interactive simulation, applying theoretical knowledge to practical Hindi word analysis tasks.

6. **Compare Morphological Patterns**: Analyze and compare morphological patterns across different Hindi word classes, understanding how different types of words encode grammatical information through word formation.

#### Learning Focus

- **Morpheme Identification**: Decompose Hindi words into root and affix components
- **Paradigm Analysis**: Understand how words change across different grammatical categories
- **Add-Delete Operations**: Master the systematic approach to morphological transformation
- **Grammatical Feature Recognition**: Identify gender, number, and case features in Hindi words
- **Pattern Recognition**: Recognize consistent morphological patterns across word classes
- **Computational Thinking**: Apply systematic analysis methods to linguistic data

#### Expected Outcomes

By the end of this experiment, students should be able to:
- Confidently analyze any Hindi word using the Add-Delete table methodology
- Identify root words and their morphological variants with high accuracy
- Understand the relationship between grammatical features and word forms
- Apply morphological analysis principles to new Hindi words
- Recognize paradigm classes and predict word behavior patterns
