After completing this experiment, students will be able to:

1. **Generate Word Forms**: Create grammatically correct word forms by combining roots with appropriate morphological features, achieving 80% accuracy across different word categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives).

2. **Apply Morphological Rules**: Correctly select and combine morphological features (gender, number, person, case, tense) to generate valid word forms in both English and Hindi, demonstrating understanding of how these features combine to create words.

3. **Compare Language Generation**: Analyze and compare word generation patterns between English and Hindi, understanding how different languages encode grammatical information through morphological processes.

4. **Practice Word Generation**: Develop hands-on skills in systematic word generation using the interactive simulation, applying theoretical knowledge to practical word formation tasks.

#### Learning Focus

- Generate words by combining roots with appropriate features
- Apply correct morphological rules for word formation
- Compare word generation patterns across English and Hindi
- Practice systematic word generation with real linguistic data
