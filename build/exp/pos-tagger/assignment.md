**1.** How is a training model formed in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for POS tagging?

**2.** How is a training model formed in a Conditional Random Field (CRF) for POS tagging?

**3.** How is testing (tagging new sentences) performed in HMM-based POS tagging?

**4.** How is testing performed in CRF-based POS tagging?

**5.** Which features (e.g., context, word, bigram/trigram) are most helpful for training a model for POS tagging, and why?

**6.** How does increasing the size of the training corpus affect the accuracy of a POS tagger?

**7.** What is the main difference between POS tagging and chunking in NLP?

**8.** Give an example of a sentence where context is crucial for correct POS tagging. Explain your answer.
