**To understand and practice syntactic chunking of sentences through interactive exploration of phrase structure across different languages.**

This experiment aims to help students develop proficiency in identifying and grouping words into syntactic chunks—such as noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases—using the IOB tagging scheme. Through hands-on interaction with sentences from English and Hindi, students will learn to annotate chunk boundaries, compare chunking patterns across languages, and understand how chunking supports higher-level NLP tasks.
