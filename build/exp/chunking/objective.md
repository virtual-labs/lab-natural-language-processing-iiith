After completing this experiment, students will be able to:

1. **Identify and Annotate Chunks**: Accurately group words into syntactic chunks (noun, verb, prepositional phrases, etc.) in sentences from English and Hindi, using the IOB tagging scheme.

2. **Analyze Sentence Structure**: Recognize and distinguish syntactic patterns that define chunk boundaries, demonstrating understanding of phrase structure in both languages.

3. **Compare Chunking Across Languages**: Analyze and compare chunking patterns and challenges between English and Hindi, understanding how different languages organize phrase structure.

4. **Practice Chunking Skills**: Develop hands-on proficiency in annotating chunk boundaries using the interactive simulation, applying theoretical knowledge to practical sentence analysis tasks.

#### Learning Focus

- Group words into syntactic chunks using IOB tags
- Identify phrase boundaries and chunk types in sentences
- Compare chunking strategies across English and Hindi
- Apply chunking principles to real linguistic data
