Follow these steps to perform N-Gram analysis using the interactive simulation:

### Step 1: Select a Corpus

- **Action**: Use the "Corpus" dropdown to select a sample corpus (e.g., English or Hindi).
- **Expected Result**: The sentences from the selected corpus will be displayed in the left pane.

### Step 2: View Sentences

- **Action**: Review the displayed sentences to understand the data you will be modeling.
- **Expected Result**: Each sentence is shown separately for clarity.

### Step 3: Generate the N-Gram Table

- **Action**: Click the "Find Bigram Probabilities" button below the corpus sentences.
- **Expected Result**: An empty N-Gram (bigram) probability table appears in the right pane.

### Step 4: Fill the N-Gram Table

- **Action**: Enter your calculated probabilities for each cell in the table based on the corpus.
- **Expected Result**: The table accepts your input for each bigram cell.

### Step 5: Check Your Answers

- **Action**: Click the "Check" button below the table.
- **Expected Result**:
  - Correct entries are highlighted in green.
  - Incorrect entries are highlighted in red.
  - You can edit and re-check as needed.

### Step 6: View the Correct Table (Optional)

- **Action**: Click the "Show Answer" button to reveal the correct bigram probabilities.
- **Expected Result**: The table is filled with the correct answers for reference.

### Step 7: Reset the Simulation (Optional)

- **Action**: Click the "Reset" button to clear all inputs and start over.
