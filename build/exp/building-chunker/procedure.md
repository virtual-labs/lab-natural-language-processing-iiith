### Step-by-Step Procedure for Building a Chunker

**Step 1: Select Language**

- Choose the target language (English or Hindi) for chunking analysis.

**Step 2: Choose Training Corpus Size**

- Select the size of the training data. Larger corpora may improve accuracy but take longer to train.

**Step 3: Select Algorithm**

- Pick the machine learning model for chunking: Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or Conditional Random Field (CRF).

**Step 4: Choose Feature Set**

- Decide which features to use for training:
  - Lexicon only
  - POS tags only
  - Lexicon + POS tags (recommended for best results)

**Step 5: Train and Evaluate**

- Click "Check Accuracy" to train the chunker and view its accuracy for your chosen configuration.
- Review example sentences with predicted chunk boundaries.

**Step 6: Experiment and Compare**

- Try different combinations of features, corpus sizes, and algorithms.
- Use "Reset / Try Another Configuration" to start over and explore more settings.

**Tips:**

- Use larger corpora and richer feature sets for higher accuracy.
- Compare HMM and CRF results to understand model differences.
- Analyze error patterns in the output to improve your chunker.

**OUTPUT:**

- The accuracy of the chunker for the selected configuration is shown.
- Example sentences with their predicted chunks are displayed for better understanding.
- You can use the "Reset / Try Another Configuration" button to start over and explore different settings.
