        "d": "The study of word meanings and definitions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Phonetics studies pronunciation, not morphology.",
        "b": "Correct! Morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies the internal structure of words and how they are formed from smaller meaningful units called morphemes.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Syntax studies sentence structure and word order, not morphology.",

      },
      "explanations": {

        "b": "Incorrect. This is a different form of the word, not the root.",
        "c": "Correct! The root word is 'लड़क' (ladak). The word 'लड़कों' is formed by adding the suffix 'ों' to indicate the oblique plural case.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Gender is an important grammatical feature analyzed in Hindi morphology.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Number (singular/plural) is a fundamental grammatical feature in Hindi.",
        "c": "Correct! Font size is a visual presentation feature, not a linguistic feature of words.",

      "question": "What is the difference between inflectional and derivational morphology in Hindi?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "There is no difference - they are the same thing",
        "b": "Inflectional morphology changes grammatical features without changing word class, while derivational morphology creates new words",
        "c": "Inflectional morphology only applies to verbs, derivational only to nouns",
        "d": "Inflectional morphology is more important than derivational morphology"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While related, inflectional and derivational morphology have distinct linguistic definitions.",
        "b": "Correct! Inflectional morphology changes grammatical features (like number, gender, case) without changing the word's core meaning or category. Derivational morphology creates new words, often changing the grammatical category.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Both inflectional and derivational morphology can apply to various word classes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Both types of morphology are equally important in language analysis."

        "c": "Plural number",
        "d": "Past tense"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Masculine singular is typically marked by '-आ' in Hindi.",
        "b": "Correct! The suffix '-ई' in Hindi typically indicates feminine gender. For example, 'लड़का' (boy) becomes 'लड़की' (girl) when the '-ई' suffix is added.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Plural number is typically marked by different suffixes like '-ए' or '-याँ'.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Past tense is marked by different morphological patterns in Hindi."

      "question": "What is a postposition in Hindi grammar?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A word that comes before a noun",

        "c": "A type of verb ending",
        "d": "A punctuation mark"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Words that come before nouns are called prepositions in English, not postpositions.",
        "b": "Correct! Postpositions in Hindi are words that follow nouns to indicate grammatical relationships, similar to prepositions in English. Common examples include 'का/की/के' (of), 'को' (to), 'में' (in), 'से' (from).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Verb endings are part of verb morphology, not postpositions.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Punctuation marks are not grammatical words."

      "question": "What is the concept of 'sandhi' in Hindi morphology?",

        "c": "A grammatical case marker",
        "d": "A type of verb conjugation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Sentence structure is studied in syntax, not morphology.",
        "b": "Correct! Sandhi refers to the process of combining morphemes with sound changes. In Hindi, this includes vowel sandhi (combining vowels), consonant sandhi (combining consonants), and visarga sandhi (changes involving visarga).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Case markers are specific grammatical elements, not a process of combination.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Verb conjugation is a different morphological process."

      "question": "How does gender agreement work in Hindi morphology?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Only nouns have gender, other words don't change",
        "b": "Gender affects only the subject of the sentence",
        "c": "Adjectives, verbs, and other words must agree with the noun's gender",
        "d": "Gender agreement is optional in Hindi"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Gender agreement affects multiple word classes in Hindi, not just nouns.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Gender agreement affects various elements in the sentence, not just subjects.",
        "c": "Correct! In Hindi, gender agreement requires that adjectives, verbs, and other related words must agree with the noun's gender. This creates a complex system where multiple words in a sentence change form based on the gender of the main noun.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Gender agreement is a fundamental grammatical requirement in Hindi."

      "question": "What is the difference between direct case (कर्ता कारक) and oblique case (कर्म कारक) in Hindi?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Direct case is used for subjects, oblique case for objects",
        "b": "Direct case is used when no postposition follows, oblique case when a postposition follows",
        "c": "Direct case is only for singular nouns, oblique case for plural nouns",
        "d": "There is no difference between them"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The distinction is not based on grammatical function but on postposition usage.",
        "b": "Correct! In Hindi, the direct case (कर्ता कारक) is used when no postposition follows the noun, while the oblique case (कर्म कारक) is used when a postposition follows the noun. This affects how the noun changes form.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Both cases can be used with singular and plural nouns.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There are clear morphological differences between direct and oblique cases in Hindi."
      },
