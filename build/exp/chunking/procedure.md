This step-by-step guide will help you navigate through the chunking simulation and learn about syntactic phrase identification.

### Step 1: Access the Instructions

1. **Click on the Instructions panel** at the top of the simulation
2. **Read through the 7-step process** to understand the workflow
3. **Keep the instructions open** for reference during the experiment

### Step 2: Language Selection

1. **Locate the "Language Selection" dropdown** in the left pane
2. **Choose your preferred language**:
   - **English**: For practicing with English sentence structures
   - **Hindi**: For exploring Hindi chunking patterns
3. **Observe**: The sentence selection options will appear after language selection

### Step 3: Sentence Selection

1. **Use the "Sentence Selection" dropdown** that appears after language selection
2. **Browse available sentences** of varying complexity levels
3. **Select a sentence** that matches your current skill level:
   - Start with simpler sentences for initial practice
   - Progress to complex sentences as you gain confidence

### Step 4: Analyze the Sentence Structure

1. **Examine the selected sentence** displayed in the results panel
2. **Identify potential word groups** that might form chunks
3. **Consider the syntactic relationships** between adjacent words
4. **Think about chunk boundaries** before making selections

### Step 5: Assign Chunk Labels

1. **Click on each word** in the sentence to select it
2. **Use the dropdown menu** that appears for each word
3. **Select the appropriate chunk type** from available options:
   - **B-NP**: Beginning of a Noun Phrase
   - **I-NP**: Inside/continuation of a Noun Phrase
   - **B-VP**: Beginning of a Verb Phrase
   - **I-VP**: Inside/continuation of a Verb Phrase

   - **O**: Outside any chunk (standalone words)

### Step 6: Review and Submit

1. **Review your chunk assignments** across the entire sentence
2. **Ensure logical chunk boundaries**:
   - Each chunk should start with a B- tag
   - Continuation words should use I- tags
   - Standalone words should be marked as O
3. **Click the "Submit" button** to check your answers

### Step 7: Evaluate Results

1. **Review the feedback** provided by the system
2. **Compare your answers** with the correct chunking
3. **Identify areas for improvement** in your chunking decisions

### Step 8: Access Correct Answers (Optional)

1. **Click the "Get Answer" button** to see the gold standard chunking
2. **Study the correct annotation patterns**
3. **Understand the reasoning** behind correct chunk assignments

### Step 9: Practice with Different Sentences

1. **Click "Try Another Sentence"** to reset the interface
2. **Select a different language or sentence** for continued practice
3. **Repeat the process** to reinforce learning
