After completing this experiment, students will be able to:

1. **Understand POS Tagging Fundamentals**: Define Part-of-Speech tagging and explain its significance in Natural Language Processing, identifying different grammatical categories (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc.) and their linguistic functions with 85% accuracy.

2. **Compare Tagging Algorithms**: Analyze and differentiate between various POS tagging algorithms including Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF), understanding their computational approaches and performance characteristics.

3. **Evaluate Feature Impact**: Assess the role of context features (unigram, bigram, trigram) in improving tagging accuracy, and analyze how training corpus size affects model performance through hands-on experimentation.

4. **Apply Interactive Analysis**: Demonstrate proficiency in using the interactive simulation to explore different algorithm configurations, interpret performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), and understand their significance in model evaluation.

5. **Analyze Cross-linguistic Patterns**: Compare POS tagging challenges and patterns between English and Hindi, understanding how linguistic ambiguity and morphological complexity affect automated tagging systems.
