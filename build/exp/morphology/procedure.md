Follow these steps to perform morphological analysis of Hindi words using the interactive simulation and Add-Delete table methodology:

### Step 1: Word Selection and Initial Analysis

#### 1.1 Select a Root Word

- **Action**: Click on the "Select Word" dropdown menu
- **Options**: Choose from the available Hindi words (e.g., बच्चा, लड़का, मकान, etc.)
- **Expected Result**: The word will be displayed in the interface, and the paradigm table will show all its morphological variants
- **Note**: Each word belongs to a specific paradigm class and will have predictable morphological patterns

#### 1.2 Observe the Paradigm Table

- **Action**: Examine the paradigm table that appears after word selection
- **Information Displayed**:
  - All morphological variants of the selected word
  - Grammatical features (Number: Singular/Plural, Case: Direct/Oblique)
  - Complete word forms for each combination
- **Purpose**: Understand the complete morphological structure of the word

### Step 2: Understanding the Add-Delete Table

#### 2.1 Analyze the Table Structure

The Add-Delete table consists of four main sections:

- **Delete Column**: What needs to be removed from the root word (leave blank if nothing is deleted)
- **Add Column**: What needs to be added to create the new form (leave blank if nothing is added)
- **Number**: Singular or Plural
- **Case**: Direct or Oblique

#### 2.2 Identify the Pattern

- **Task**: Observe how the root word transforms across different grammatical categories
- **Look For**:
  - Consistent deletion patterns
  - Systematic addition patterns
  - Relationship between grammatical features and morphological changes

### Step 3: Interactive Analysis Using Add-Delete Table

#### 3.1 Fill the Delete Column

- **Action**: For each row in the Add-Delete table, identify what part of the root word needs to be deleted
- **Method**:
  - Compare the root word with the target form
  - Identify the common part that remains
  - Determine what part needs to be removed
  - If nothing is deleted, leave the field blank
- **Example**: For बच्चा → बच्चे, you need to delete आ (aa)

#### 3.2 Fill the Add Column

- **Action**: For each row, identify what suffix needs to be added
- **Method**:
  - Look at the target word form
  - Identify the suffix that creates the desired grammatical feature
  - Select the appropriate suffix from the dropdown options
  - If nothing is added, leave the field blank
- **Example**: For बच्चा → बच्चे (plural), you need to add ए (e)

#### 3.3 Verify Grammatical Features

- **Action**: Ensure the Number and Case columns match the target word form
- **Check**:
  - **Number**: Is the target form singular or plural?
  - **Case**: Is the target form in direct or oblique case?
- **Reference**: Use the paradigm table to verify the correct grammatical features

### Step 4: Answer Verification and Learning

#### 4.1 Submit Your Analysis

- **Action**: Click the "Check Answer" button after filling all dropdowns
- **Expected Result**:
  - ✅ Correct answers will be highlighted in green
  - ❌ Incorrect answers will be highlighted in red
  - Feedback message will indicate overall performance

#### 4.2 Learn from Results

- **Action**: Review the feedback and identify areas for improvement
- **Focus On**:
  - Patterns you missed
  - Incorrect suffix selections
  - Misunderstanding of grammatical features
- **Strategy**: Try to understand why certain answers were incorrect

#### 4.3 Use the "Get Answer" Feature

- **Action**: Click the "Get Answer" button to see the correct solutions
- **Expected Result**:
  - All dropdowns will be set to the correct answers
  - The complete Add-Delete table will be displayed with correct transformations
  - Detailed explanation of the morphological analysis will be shown

### Step 5: Practice and Mastery

#### 5.1 Try Different Words

- **Action**: Select different words from the dropdown to practice with various paradigm classes
- **Learning Objective**:
  - Recognize different morphological patterns
  - Understand paradigm class variations
  - Develop pattern recognition skills

#### 5.2 Compare Paradigm Classes

- **Action**: Analyze words from different paradigm classes
- **Compare**:
  - Deletion patterns across different word types
  - Addition patterns for similar grammatical features
  - Consistency of morphological rules

#### 5.3 Reset and Retry

- **Action**: Use the "Reset" button to clear all selections and start fresh
- **Purpose**:
  - Practice without seeing previous answers
  - Test your understanding independently
  - Build confidence in morphological analysis

### Tips for Success

#### Analytical Approach

- **Start with the Root**: Always identify the base form of the word first
- **Compare Forms**: Look at how the word changes across different grammatical categories
- **Look for Patterns**: Identify consistent morphological rules within paradigm classes
- **Use the Paradigm Table**: Reference the complete paradigm to understand the word's behavior

#### Common Patterns to Remember

- **Masculine Nouns ending in -आ**: Usually delete आ and add different suffixes
- **Plural Forms**: Often involve adding -ए or -ओं depending on case
- **Oblique Case**: Typically requires different suffixes than direct case
- **Invariant Words**: Some words (like पानी, दूध) don't change across forms; for these, both Add and Delete columns remain blank

#### Error Prevention

- **Double-check Grammatical Features**: Ensure you're targeting the correct number and case
- **Verify Suffix Selection**: Make sure the suffix creates the intended grammatical form
- **Use Context Clues**: Consider the meaning and usage of the target word form
- **Reference the Paradigm**: Always check against the complete paradigm table

### Expected Learning Outcomes

By following this procedure, you will develop:

- **Systematic Analysis Skills**: Ability to break down words systematically
- **Pattern Recognition**: Understanding of consistent morphological rules
- **Grammatical Awareness**: Knowledge of how grammatical features affect word forms
- **Computational Thinking**: Systematic approach to linguistic analysis
- **Hindi Morphology Expertise**: Deep understanding of Hindi word structure

This hands-on approach will help you master the Add-Delete table methodology and become proficient in Hindi morphological analysis.
