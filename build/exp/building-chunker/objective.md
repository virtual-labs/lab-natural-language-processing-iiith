After completing this experiment, students will be able to:

1. **Build a Chunker**: Implement chunking using HMM and CRF models for NLP tasks.
2. **Experiment with Features**: Analyze how different feature sets (lexicon, POS tags) affect chunking accuracy.
3. **Evaluate Corpus Size Impact**: Assess how training data size influences model performance.
4. **Visualize and Interpret Results**: Use simulation outputs to compare chunking accuracy and error patterns.
5. **Apply Chunking Knowledge**: Understand the role of chunking in downstream NLP applications (information extraction, parsing, etc.).

#### Learning Focus

- Construct chunkers using different algorithms and features
- Compare chunking accuracy across configurations
- Apply chunking principles to real linguistic data
