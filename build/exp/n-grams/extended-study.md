### Advanced Learning Activities for N-Grams

#### 1. Comparative N-Gram Analysis

**Activity**: Compare bigram and trigram models on the same corpus.

- **Task**: Build both models and analyze how sentence probability estimates differ.
- **Learning Goal**: Understand the impact of context window size on language modeling.
- **Tools**: Use the simulation or write a simple script in Python.

#### 2. Smoothing Experiment

**Activity**: Explore the effect of smoothing on unseen N-Grams.

- **Task**: Calculate sentence probabilities with and without smoothing.
- **Learning Goal**: See how smoothing prevents zero probabilities and improves model robustness.
- **Method**: Apply Laplace smoothing to your N-Gram table.

#### 3. Historical N-Gram Study

**Activity**: Investigate how N-Gram frequencies change over time.

- **Task**: Use the Google Books Ngram Viewer to track the popularity of phrases.
- **Learning Goal**: Discover trends in language usage and cultural shifts.
- **Resources**: https://books.google.com/ngrams

#### 4. Build Your Own N-Gram Predictor

**Activity**: Implement a simple N-Gram text generator.

- **Task**: Write a program that generates sentences by sampling from an N-Gram model.
- **Learning Goal**: Apply theoretical knowledge to practical text generation.
- **Tools**: Python, JavaScript, or any language of your choice.

### Research Topics for Advanced Study

#### 1. N-Gram Models vs. Neural Language Models

- **Research Question**: How do N-Gram models compare to modern neural approaches in terms of accuracy and resource requirements?
- **Applications**: Low-resource language modeling, embedded systems.

#### 2. Cross-Linguistic N-Gram Patterns

- **Research Question**: What N-Gram patterns are universal across languages, and which are language-specific?
- **Methods**: Analyze corpora from multiple languages and compare N-Gram distributions.
