## Overview

This Virtual Lab experiment focuses on **Chunking (Shallow Parsing)**, providing an interactive learning experience for understanding how words are grouped into syntactically meaningful phrases in natural language processing. Students will learn to identify and annotate chunk boundaries using the IOB tagging scheme across English and Hindi languages.

## Experiment Structure

### ðŸ“š Core Learning Materials

1. **[Aim](aim.md)** - Clear learning objectives and focus areas for chunking
2. **[Objectives](objective.md)** - Specific, measurable learning goals
3. **[Theory](theory.md)** - Comprehensive background on chunking, IOB tagging, and cross-linguistic analysis
4. **[Procedure](procedure.md)** - Step-by-step instructions for the interactive simulation
5. **[References](references.md)** - Comprehensive resource list for deeper study

### ðŸŽ¯ Assessment & Practice

- **[Pre-test](pretest.json)** - 9 questions to assess prior knowledge of syntactic concepts
- **[Post-test](posttest.json)** - 9 questions to measure learning outcomes and chunking skills
- **[Assignment](assignment.md)** - Additional practice exercises and real-world applications

### ðŸ’» Interactive Simulation

The experiment includes a fully functional web-based simulation located in the `simulation/` directory that allows students to:

#### Core Features

- **Language Selection**: Choose between English and Hindi for analysis
- **Sentence Practice**: Work with pre-selected sentences of varying complexity
- **Interactive Chunking**: Click on words and assign appropriate chunk tags
- **IOB Tagging**: Practice with the Inside-Outside-Beginning annotation scheme
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate evaluation of chunking decisions
- **Answer Verification**: Compare manual annotations with gold standard answers

#### Supported Chunk Types

- **Noun Phrases (NP)**: Groups containing nouns and their modifiers
- **Verb Phrases (VP)**: Groups containing verbs and auxiliaries
- **Prepositional Phrases (PP)**: English prepositions (separate from NP arguments)
- **Adverbial Phrases (ADVP)**: Adverb groups and modifiers
- **Adjectival Phrases (ADJP)**: Adjective groups and modifiers

#### Cross-Linguistic Features

- **English Chunking**: Standard phrase types with prepositions as separate chunks
- **Hindi Chunking**: Postpositions included within noun phrases, SOV word order
- **Comparative Analysis**: Understand structural differences between languages

## Learning Path

### For Beginners

1. Start with the **[Aim](aim.md)** and **[Objectives](objective.md)** to understand chunking goals
2. Read the **[Theory](theory.md)** for foundational concepts of phrase structure
3. Take the **[Pre-test](pretest.json)** to assess your starting knowledge
4. Follow the **[Procedure](procedure.md)** to navigate the simulation effectively
5. Practice with simple English sentences first, then progress to Hindi
6. Take the **[Post-test](posttest.json)** to measure your progress

### For Intermediate Learners

1. Complete the beginner path above
2. Focus on complex sentence structures with multiple phrase types
3. Practice distinguishing between similar chunk types (NP vs PP attachment)
4. Experiment with both languages to understand cross-linguistic differences
5. Try the **[Assignment](assignment.md)** exercises for advanced practice
6. Use the **[References](references.md)** for deeper theoretical understanding

### For Advanced Learners

1. Master both English and Hindi chunking patterns
2. Focus on ambiguous cases and complex coordination structures
3. Understand evaluation metrics and chunking system performance
4. Explore applications in information extraction and parsing
5. Study recent research and computational approaches to chunking
