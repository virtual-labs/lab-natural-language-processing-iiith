After completing this experiment, students will be able to:

1. **Understand HMM Fundamentals**: Define Hidden Markov Models and explain their application to POS tagging, identifying the role of hidden states, observations, and probability matrices with 85% accuracy.

2. **Calculate Probability Matrices**: Compute transition and emission probabilities from annotated training corpora, demonstrating understanding of how statistical patterns are extracted from linguistic data.

3. **Apply the Viterbi Algorithm**: Implement and trace through the Viterbi algorithm to find optimal POS tag sequences, understanding dynamic programming principles in sequence labeling tasks.

4. **Analyze Contextual Disambiguation**: Evaluate how HMMs resolve word ambiguity through contextual probabilities, comparing different tag sequences and their likelihood scores.

5. **Interpret Model Performance**: Assess the impact of training data size and probability values on tagging accuracy, understanding the relationship between data quality and model effectiveness.
