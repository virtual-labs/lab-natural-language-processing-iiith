      "question": "What is the primary input required for morphological word generation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A complete sentence",
        "b": "A root word and grammatical features",
        "c": "A dictionary definition",
        "d": "Audio pronunciation"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Word generation works at the word level, not sentence level.",
        "b": "Correct! Morphological generation requires a root word and grammatical features (like tense, number, gender) to create the correct word form.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Dictionary definitions provide meaning, not the structural information needed for generation.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Audio pronunciation is not used in morphological generation processes."

    },
    {
      "question": "In morphological generation, what does 'cat=v' typically indicate?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The word is about cats",
        "b": "The word category is verb",
        "c": "The word has a 'v' sound",
        "d": "The word is very important"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 'cat' in this context is an abbreviation, not related to the animal.",
        "b": "Correct! 'cat=v' indicates that the word category is verb, which affects how other features are applied.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This notation refers to grammatical category, not phonetic sounds.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The abbreviation has nothing to do with importance levels."
      },
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which feature would be most relevant when generating the word 'played' from the root 'play'?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Color",
        "b": "Tense",
        "c": "Font",
        "d": "Size"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Color is a visual property, not a grammatical feature.",
        "b": "Correct! Tense is the key feature that transforms 'play' into 'played' (past tense).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Font is a typographical choice, not a linguistic feature.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Size is not a grammatical feature in morphological generation."

      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the simulation demonstrate the concept of feature interaction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By showing that features work independently",
        "b": "By demonstrating how features like gender and number work together",
        "c": "By proving that only one feature matters",
        "d": "By showing that features are randomly assigned"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Features often interact with each other in morphological generation.",
        "b": "Correct! The simulation shows how features interact, such as gender affecting number forms in Hindi (लड़का/लड़के).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Multiple features typically work together to generate correct word forms.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Features follow systematic grammatical rules, not random assignment."

    },
    {
      "question": "What challenge does irregular morphology present for word generation systems?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Irregular forms follow no patterns and must be memorized",
        "b": "Irregular forms are always longer than regular forms",
        "c": "Irregular forms only exist in English",
        "d": "Irregular forms are always wrong"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Irregular forms like 'children' (from 'child') don't follow regular patterns and must be stored as exceptions.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Length is not a defining characteristic of irregular forms.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Many languages have irregular morphological forms.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Irregular forms are valid and correct, just unpredictable."
      },
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why might a word generation system need to handle multiple scripts for the same language?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To make the system more complex",
        "b": "Because different scripts may have different morphological rules",
        "c": "To confuse users",
        "d": "Scripts don't affect word generation"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Complexity is not the goal; accuracy is.",
        "b": "Correct! Different scripts (like Roman vs Devanagari for Hindi) may have different morphological patterns and rules.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The purpose is to accurately represent the language, not to confuse users.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Script can significantly affect morphological generation rules."

    {
      "question": "What is the most significant advantage of morphological generation being deterministic?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It requires less computer memory",
        "b": "It produces predictable and consistent results",
        "c": "It works faster than non-deterministic systems",
        "d": "It only works with simple languages"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Memory usage is not the primary advantage of determinism.",
        "b": "Correct! Deterministic generation ensures that the same input always produces the same output, making it reliable and predictable.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Speed is not necessarily related to determinism.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Deterministic systems can work with complex languages too."

      "difficulty": "advanced"
    },
    {
      "question": "In what way does morphological generation differ from simple template filling?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Generation requires understanding of linguistic rules and feature interactions",
        "b": "Generation is always easier than template filling",
        "c": "Generation only works with nouns",
        "d": "There is no difference between them"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Morphological generation requires deep understanding of how linguistic features interact, not just simple slot-filling.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Generation can be more complex due to feature interactions and exceptions.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Generation works with all word categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.).",
        "d": "Incorrect. Generation is much more sophisticated than simple template filling."

    {
      "question": "What makes cross-linguistic morphological generation particularly challenging?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All languages have identical grammar rules",
        "b": "Different languages have vastly different morphological systems and feature sets",
        "c": "Cross-linguistic generation is impossible",
        "d": "Only vocabulary differences matter"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Languages have very different grammatical systems and rules.",
        "b": "Correct! Different languages have different morphological systems - Hindi has gender and case, English has different tense systems, etc.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Cross-linguistic generation is possible but challenging.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Morphological differences are as important as vocabulary differences."
